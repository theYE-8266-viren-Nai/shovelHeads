## Our Story
In the gritty, rain-soaked streets of Yangon, where the weather bites with a relentless edge, two teenage rebels fueled by the roaring grunge revolution of the 90s banded together. Led by the fierce vocals of Layate Min Htet, they forged Shovelheads—a name that screams defiance. In 2024, with the lineup still a wild card, Layate and bassist Htet Aung unleashed their untamed creativity, hammering out drums, guitar, bass, and vocals with raw intensity.
